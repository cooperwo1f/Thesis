\chapter{Future Work}
There are a number of recommendations for future work on the project.

Firstly, the on-body device should be revised.
The device that has previously been developed is a good starting point.
However, the next revision should include a more prototyping friendly design (more LEDs, test points, etc.),
improved power distribution, and potentially simplified wireless communication,
would allow the project to be developed further.

Another aspect of future work that could be undertaken is the development of wearable sensors.
There is room for a lot of research and experimentation when it comes to ergonomic sensor design.

Further developments can be made in the software aspect of the project.
Generally, the communication speeds between all the devices could be increased.
At present, speeds are lower than the maximum capacity of the devices to ensure communication is consistent.
There are also a lot of unnecessary overheads on a number of the communication lines.
This was to get the devices connected, but further work could be done to optimize this communication.

Lastly, the system could be tested in a real live performance space.
There is obviously work that would need to be completed before that would be possible.
However, with that work complete, a live performance test with feedback from the performers would be of immense value.
