## Types of Biosignals

- Electrocardiogram (ECG) [ref][ECG]
  - ECG measures electrical activity generated by the heart
  - Used to monitor heartbeat (Islam et al., 2012).

  - Pros:
    - Rythmic signal
    - Correlates nicely to movement

  - Cons:
    - Interference from other electronic devices
      - Powerline interference (Joshi et al., 2013).
      - Solved using Hilbert Transform (Benitez et al., 2001).
    - Motion artifacts
      - Signal effected by body movement (Joshi et al., 2013).
      - Solved using noise-cancelling algorithms (Kumar et al., 2012).
    - Baseline drift
      - Drift of the ECG signal about the x-axis (Chouhan and Mehta, 2007).
      - Implementing least square error correction algorithm (Chouhan and Mehta, 2007).

  - Cost
    - ~$21.50 [link](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12650)



- Electromyogram (EMG) [ref][EMG]
  - Recording of the changes in electric potential of muscle

  - Pros
    - Less intrusive user interface
    - Muscle control is easier to consciously control than other biosignals

  - Cons
    - Non rythmic signal
    - Electrodes require clean, direct contact

  - Cost
    - ~$40 [link](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/21265)



- Electroencephalogram (EEG) [ref][EEG]
  - Recording electric currents developed in the brain using electrodes applied to the scalp
  
  - Pros
    - Brain activity measurement is interesting 
    - Potentially very user controllable

  - Cons
    - Non rythmic signal
    - Signals are low in magnitude and are not appropriate in high noise environments
    - User interface is bulky



- Electrooculography [ref][Electrooculography]
  - Recording potential arising between cornea and the retina
  
  - Pros
    - Ability to measure eye movements
    - Eye movements are one of the easier biosignals to control from the user perspective
    
  - Cons
    - Non rythmic signal
    - Intrusive interface
      - Requires electrodes to be placed on specific positions on the face



- Galvanic Skin Response [ref][Galvanic Skin Response]
  - Change in electrical resistance of the skin
  - Can __vaguely_ measure change of emotion and mental workload

  - Pros
    - Interesting measurement relating to mental workload

  - Cons
    - Non rythmic signal
    - Skin conductivity is not consciously controllable



## Other Types of Biosignals

- Imaging Techniques
  - Measuring biological changes using image processing [ref][Imaging Techniques]
  
  - Pros
    - Potentially very interesting results

  - Cons
    - Massive increase in system cost due to full image processing requirement
    - Imaging techniques typically used for one-off diagnostics rather than monitoring
      - Potentially not real-time



- Electrophysiologic [ref][Electrophysiologic]
  - Measure of electrical activities at specific sites in the heart
  
  - Cons
    - Potentially quite difficult to perform
    - Similar to ECG just more specific



- Magnetoencephalography [ref][Magnetoencephalography]
  - Measurement of magnetic fields over the head generated by electric currents in the brain
  
  - Pros
    - Can measure brain activity without needing to physically add electrodes to the head

  - Cons
    - Machines are typically very large and very expensive
    - Signals are very small in magnitude and thus would not be appropriate for electrically noisey environments
