** Assuming at this point that the system has been described and the previous contributions are clear, as well as what has been planned to be implemented**

- Lighting Output

- Off-body PC

- On-body Device
    -- ESP32
    -- PIC32
    -- ADS129

- System Integration
The systems works with Xms latency.
The system is able to transmit with 0 bit error rate over 10000 bits.
