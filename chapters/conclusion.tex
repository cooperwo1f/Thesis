\chapter{Conclusion}
This project was a continuation of the Music from Biosignals project.
It focused on developing the hardware for biosignal acquisition, and a controller for controlling lighting fixtures.
The project was successful in creating the lighting controller, as well as programming the hardware.
However, due to previous board design issues, the devices were not able to be powered together.
Therefore, while the device to device connections on the board were tested and working,
the fully system integration was not able to be completed.

This project succeeded in demonstrating the design flaws of the on-body device, while also providing a number of recommendations for a future redesign.
