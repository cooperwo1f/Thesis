%\noindent\enquote{\itshape One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem in becoming your own father or mother that a broad-minded and well-adjusted family can't cope with. There is no problem with changing the course of historyâ€”the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end.

%The major problem is simply one of grammar, and the main work to consult in this matter is Dr. Dan Streetmentioner's Time Traveler's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will tell you, for instance, how to describe something that was about to happen to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping forward two days in order to avoid it. The event will be descibed differently according to whether you are talking about it from the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the further future, or a time in the further past and is futher complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations while you are actually traveling from one time to another with the intention of becoming your own mother or father.

%Most readers get as far as the Future Semiconditionally Modified Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up; and in fact in later aditions of the book all pages beyond this point have been left blank to save on printing costs.

%The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy skips lightly over this tangle of academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the term "Future Perfect" has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be.}\bigbreak

  This thesis aims to establish a platform for performers to utilize biological signals in order to create engaging live performances.
  This project is a continuation of the `Music from Biosignals' project, with the new addition of lighting control.

  The initial phase of the project began with the implementation of the lighting controller,
  enabling the system to interface with standard performance lighting fixtures.
  There are two parts of the lighting controller,
  an off-the-shelf controller, ensuring high reliability,
  and a prototyping fixture, allowing fast and cost-effective testing.
  These additions allow for the creation of exciting and engaging lighting patterns from collected biosensors.

  Further project developments involved the previously designed hardware,
  consisting of a PIC32 microcontroller, an ESP32 wireless transmitter, and an ADS1294R analog-to-digital converter.
  For this hardware, programming inconsistencies were resolved,
  over-the-air updates were implemented for the ESP32,
  and hardware debugging was enabled for the PIC32.

  Following this, consistent device-to-device communication was etablished.
  With successful communication between the PIC32 and ESP32 over SPI,
  challenges overcome with communication between the ADS1294R and PIC32,
  and the ESP32 acting as a wireless bridge with the off-body PC via TCP/IP.

  Despite these achievements, power issues during the final stage of development caused the device to fail in providing wireless sensor readings for the off-body PC to process.
  Thorough testing showed that the issue was related to the high impedance of the power plane.
  In conclusion, while the performance augmentation platform is not fully functional, significant strides have been made in resolving communication issues and establishing a foundation for future iterations.
  Recommendations for a second version include addressing power distribution challenges and optimizing overall current draw.
