  abstract= {Biosignal sensors are now small, affordable, and wireless. We desire to include such sensors (e.g. heart rate, respiration, acceleration) in a live musical performance, which sets requirements on the reliability and variability of the data. Unfortunately the raw signals from such devices are unable to meet these requirements. We contribute our solutions for overcoming the shortcomings of these sensors in two parts. The first is an online data processing and analysis system, including on-line generative models that describe the signals but add consistency. The second is the end-to-end system for capturing wireless signal data for the analysis system and integrating the resulting output into a popular digital audio workstation in a very flexible manner conducive to live performance. We also explore the role of ``analysis supervisor''---a member of the performing act who ensures that the results of biosignal analysis fall within the desired ranges to contribute to the music effectively.},
